If you receive any errors while running this program, regarding the JRE or the Java Virtual Machine,
try installing the JRE manually and running the application again.

## Release Notes
The following release notes apply only to **AkDOS 0.90a**:

+ Finished a working rudimentary user interface for AkDOS
+ Created dummy interactions to simulate in-game events (such as `ping admin` that in our game
will notify the new administrators of the Aegis kai Doru secure network of the protagonists'
meddling)
+ Created methods for password-protecting access to the secure network
+ Implemented constructors and accessors for entries on the Aegis kai Doru database

### Future features
The following features will be implemented in future versions of the program, hopefully
before we hit the big 1.0:
+ Hacking mini-game
+ Input for character's Attribute and Skill ratings that will influence the outcome of the hacking
effort
+ Internal dice roller for characters and the NPC system administrator
+ Terminal chat
+ Randomly occurring supernatural events and interactions with NPCs, entities (such as the God Machine,
ghosts, spirits etc.) who may manifest through the terminal
